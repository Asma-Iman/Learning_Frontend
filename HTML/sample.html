        <p>One page. Endless CSS possibilities.</p>
        <p>
            This hero section is intentionally text-heavy so you can

        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                This website exists purely for practicing CSS. The goal
                is not perfection, but experimentation. Try changing
                fonts, margins, and layout styles to see how each
                property affects readability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Web design is as much about restraint as it is about
                creativity. Proper spacing, consistent typography,
                and subtle color choices often matter more than flashy
                effects.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also practice setting a maximum width for text
                containers so that paragraphs do not stretch too wide
                on large screens.

        <!-- HOBBIES SECTION -->
        <section>
            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

            <p>
                Hobbies give personality to a website. This section
                can be styled as a list, a grid, or even cards depending
                on how you want the layout to feel.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reading books and articles</li>
                <li>Coding small side projects</li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Exploring new technologies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Try adding icons, hover effects, or custom bullet styles
                using CSS pseudo-elements.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CARD SECTION -->
        <section>
            <h2>Featured Cards</h2>

            <p>
                Cards are everywhere on the web. They are used for
                products, blog previews, profiles, and dashboards.
                This makes them perfect for layout practice.
            </p>

            <div>
                <article>
                    <h3>Card One</h3>
                    <p>
                        This card contains a short paragraph that you
                        can style with padding, shadows, and hover
                        transitions.

                    <h3>Card Two</h3>
                    <p>
                        Try changing the height of cards and making all
                        cards equal in size using flexbox or grid.
                    </p>
                    <button>Read More</button>

                    <h3>Card Three</h3>
                    <p>
                        Add animations on hover, change background
                        colors, or slightly lift the card for a
                        modern UI feel.

                <h3>First Blog Post</h3>
                <p>January 25, 2026</p>

                <p>
                    Blog layouts are excellent for typography practice.
                    Focus on font size hierarchy between headings,
                    dates, and body text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can also experiment with drop caps, custom
                    paragraph spacing, or subtle separators between
                    sections of content.
                </p>

                <h3>Second Blog Post</h3>
                <p>January 26, 2026</p>

                <p>
                    This post is slightly longer so you can see how
                    multi-paragraph articles behave inside containers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Try adding a background color to the article,
                    increasing line height, and limiting width for
                    improved readability.

            <p>
                Forms are one of the most important parts of any
                website. Styling them well improves usability and
                accessibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                Try customizing input borders, focus states, and button
                hover effects to make the form feel interactive and
                polished.
            </p>

            <form>
                <label>Name</label>
